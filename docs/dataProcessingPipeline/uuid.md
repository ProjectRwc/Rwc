**UUIDs** are a handy way of representing a unique ID. It's essentially a large random number
stored as a string, and UUIDs are generated simply by picking a random number. Each generated UUID
is virtually guaranteed to be different than any other randomly generated UUID, as there are more
possible UUIDs than atoms in the observable universe.
